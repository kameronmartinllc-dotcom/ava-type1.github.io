    "title": "Eledon Pharmaceuticals Breakthrough: Tegoprubart Shows Promise for Type 1 Diabetes Treatment",
    "summary": "Eledon Pharmaceuticals is developing tegoprubart, a medication that blocks a specific immune system signal (CD40L) that causes the body to attack its own cells. While being tested for organ transplants, this same mechanism could potentially stop the immune system from destroying insulin-producing cells in Type 1 Diabetes. Think of it as turning off the 'attack switch' that causes the disease.",

Think of it like a targeted delivery system that could help slow down or stop the immune system attack on the pancreas. If successful, this could mean better preservation of natural insulin production, especially for people recently diagnosed."
