    "title": "Eledon Pharmaceuticals Breakthrough: Tegoprubart Shows Promise for Type 1 Diabetes Treatment",
    "summary": "Eledon Pharmaceuticals is developing tegoprubart, a medication that blocks a specific immune system signal (CD40L) that causes the body to attack its own cells. While being tested for organ transplants, this same mechanism could potentially stop the immune system from destroying insulin-producing cells in Type 1 Diabetes. Think of it as turning off the 'attack switch' that causes the disease.",

Unlike insulin which just treats symptoms, this aims to slow or stop the underlying disease process. Getting treatment early (before all insulin production is lost) could preserve natural insulin production longer, meaning better blood sugar control and potentially fewer complications."
