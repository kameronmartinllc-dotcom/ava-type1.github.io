    "summary": "Eledon Pharmaceuticals is developing tegoprubart, a medication that blocks a specific immune system signal (CD40L) that causes the body to attack its own cells. While being tested for organ transplants, this same mechanism could potentially stop the immune system from destroying insulin-producing cells in Type 1 Diabetes. Think of it as turning off the 'attack switch' that causes the disease.",
