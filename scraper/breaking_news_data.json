      "heading": "\ud83d\udd2c What This Means for Families:",
      "content": "This represents one of the most significant advances in T1D treatment in recent years. The medication targets the underlying autoimmune process that destroys insulin-producing cells, potentially slowing or even halting disease progression. Early results suggest it may be particularly effective when administered early in the disease course, offering hope for preserving natural insulin production and reducing long-term complications."
